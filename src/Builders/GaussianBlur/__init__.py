The GaussianBlur package have the file GaussianBlurBuilder.py, that have implemented the class GaussianBlurBuilder.
This class will receive an image in (color/gray) and will return an image with a Gaussian Blur
of the original as result, you will see the same image but with a new blur effect on it.

Also have a small class "WindowBuilder" it´s a window for some settings that the user may need. Values
apply on the gaussian blur function.

Gaussian blur / Gaussian smoothing:
    is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function.
    It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail.

Gaussian Blur Function: It is a widely used effect in graphics software,
typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail.
Gaussian smoothing is also used as a
pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at
different scales—see scale space representation and scale space implementation.
